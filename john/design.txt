  typedef struct {
    char type;
    char *value;
    void *newvalue;
  } jhn_value;

storing the value in its original string form

optional newvalue... or else stringify immediately into value

isn't a union better?

lots of casting, but why not...

  typedef struct {
    char type;
    void *value;
  } jhn_value;
